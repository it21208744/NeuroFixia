The proposed solution is a comprehensive system designed to identify and improve outcomes 
for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by integrating advanced technology with 
tailored interventions. The system focuses on four key areas: Behavioral Observation, Social 
Skills Observation, Sensory Processing Observation, and Learning Abilities Observation.
1. Behavioral Observation: Diagnose autism in real-time using eye-tracking technology to 
monitor and analyze children's behaviors, such as eye contact and the ability to identify facial 
expressions. Also, focus on behavioral aspects like repetitive head and hand movements, 
providing a risk assessment of autism based on predictive models.
2. Social Skills Observation: Implement a questionnaire-based approach targeting 
parents to gather data on children's social interactions and responsiveness, and activities for 
children which are then analyzed to predict autism risk and suggest activities which help to 
improve those social skills struggled by the child.
3. Sensory Processing Observation: Measures children's sensory responses to specific 
stimuli, such as lights and sounds, colors, touch, temperature smells and tastes to identify 
autism-related sensitivities. This data is used to train models that assess autism risk.
4. Learning Abilities Observation: Assesses children's educational and cognitive skills 
through structured tasks and evaluations, such as attention span, memory recall, and flexible 
thinking. The collected data is analyzed to identify specific learning challenges and predict the 
likelihood of autism
The system integrates these observations into a holistic framework that not only identifies 
autism but also proposes personalized activities aimed at improving the developmental 
outcomes for each child. By combining technology with targeted interventions, the solution 
aims to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being of children on the autism spectrum.
